# Financial Tracker Application Project

## Description of the Financial Tracker Application Project

Financial Tracker is a simple Java application that allows users to manage their payments and deposits.
Users can enter details like date, time, description, vendor, and amount for each transaction:

1. Add Deposits: Record incomes with the help of date, time, description, and vendor for the amount such that inflows are traced easily.
2. Add Payments: Record expenses as negative transactions to make tracking of financial outlays easier.
3. Transactions View: A ledger of all transactions for clear visibility to track financial history easily.
4. Filter Transactions: Transactions can be filtered by date range or by vendor in order to analyze spending habits.
5. Report Generation: Provide the generation of reports based on month-to-date transactions or spend by vendor for further analysis.
